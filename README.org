* monstar
A C++ library for MONitoring an application and sending data to grafana to generate STAtistics and Reporting.


** Purpose

   MONSTAR is a library I created to simplify monitoring C++
   applications using Grafana together with Elasticsearch and
   Graphite.

** Use Cases

   Monstar currently supports three use cases:

   - In instant simple numeric information in Graphite.
   - In instant scope benchmarking.
   - Event based message transation to time-series data.  This
     currently only supports Elasticsearch data.


   The easiest way to get started with MONSTAR is probably to work
   through the examples in the examples directory.  At the moment
   those only cover the last use-case, but there are examples of the
   other two use cases within the implementation of MONSTAR.

   More examples to come.


** Warning:

   While I hope this is already useful for people, the project is not
   partiularly mature.  I am actively developing and testing the
   library, so the interface is subject to change, and there's
   probably a lot of errors and suboptimal stuff.  Feedbacck and pull
   requests are welcome!

* TODO'S

** TODO Make a fwd decl header.

** TODO Accept streams for logging.
